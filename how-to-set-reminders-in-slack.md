# **What** is Slack?

Slack is a communication and collaboration platform that organizes conversations into topics, groups or private messages.  Each topic or group is called a Channel.  Hack for LA uses slack to allow teams to connect, discuss and work on projects collectively.  There are channels set up for both specific projects, and specific functional roles. 


# **When** to use Reminders ⏰

Slack has a function that **allows you to set up an automatic reminder with a tailored message **sent out by the Bot at a specified time.  

**Who to setup reminders for**
* Yourself 
* Someone else 
* The Whole Channel

**Type of Reminders**

* Remind the team about upcoming team meetings
* Remind people to update issues by a certain date
* Remind yourself to check back in with someone at a certain time


# **How** to Set Reminders ☑️

**Reminders can be set up in two ways:**
